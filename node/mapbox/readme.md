The directory contains following samples

> **note**: to get samples working you need to replace Mapbox token stores in a `mapboxgl.accessToken` variable from inside `index.html` file

- `custom_markers`
- `marker_position`
- `distance`
- `interactive_hover`
- `draw_points`
- `draw_path`
- `linterp_position`

The common way to get up and running sample is with

```bash
npm install
```

command to initialize node dependencies and

```bash
./serve
```

> or `node app.js` if serve not present

command tu run the sample.

Then just open `localhost:3000` to play with the sample.
